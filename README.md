# US Energy Infrastructure Visualization

The US Energy Infrastructure Visualization is a data visualization web app that classifies and displays nationwide infrastructure data by infrastructure type, total asset value, and location on a map of the United States. The project uses D3.js to process the data and render the maps, allowing users to select layers grouped into the following categories:

* gas wells
* offshore wells
* oil and gas pipelines
* oil refineries
* gas processing and storage
* coal mines
* railroads
* electricity transmission grid
* power plants   


This project is the result of a grant-funded partnership between the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and the [Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy](https://www.rdcep.org/) designed to generate data visualizations that can be used by policy-makers and educators. 



## Getting Started

`git clone`
`python run.py`

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed on your machine; install [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/) flask_assets, and flask_compress if you haven't already:
`python --version`
`pip --version`
`pip install flask`
`pip install flask_assets`
`pip install flask_compress`

## Structure

The web app is built with [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and is 
organized in a pretty run-of-the-mill no-frills
manner.

 * `/static/js` is the business. 
 
   * `energy-maps.init.X.vY.js` files load data 
 files and initialize the mapping functions for
 various maps (defined by the X in filename).
 
   * `energy-maps.funcs.X.vY.js` files contain 
 functions relevant to the various maps.
 
   * `energy-maps.funcs.vY.js` contain 
 functions relevant to all of the various 
 maps.
 
   * `energy-maps.globals.vY.js` contain 
 variables relevant to all of the various 
 maps.
 
   * `energy-maps.legends.vY.js` contain 
 functions responsible for drawing map 
 legends.
 
 * `/static/json` and `/static/csv` contain 
 data files.

 * `/static/css` and `/static/sass` contain project stylesheets.
   * All styling is written in SCSS and compiled down to CSS like so: 
   `sass main.v#.sass main.v#.css`

## API

 * [Node/Express microservice](https://hidden-brook-47088.herokuapp.com/)
 * [Endpoints on Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9183499/SWLce9RF?version=latest)
 
## Style Guide

 * Function names are snake_case()
 * Fat arrow functions are generally avoided
 * Descriptive variable names are used rather than magic numbers
 * `let` rather than `var`, `const` whenever possible.
 * [JSDoc](https://devhints.io/jsdoc) is used whenever possible. Documentation is generated by `jsdoc energy_maps/static/js/* -d energy_maps/docs`
 * Curly braces open at the end of a line and close on their own line, like so:
    * `if (i === foo) {`
      * `bar()`
    * `}`
