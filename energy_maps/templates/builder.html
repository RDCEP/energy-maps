      <h4>About.</h4>

      <p>At a time when many people propose transforming the U.S. energy system, 
        it is useful to understand its scale. The U.S. Energy Infrastructure 
        Visualization project documents all long-lived infrastructure 
        (> 20 years service life) associated with extracting, processing, 
        transporting, and converting energy in the U.S.</p>
      <p>The energy system that delivers power to U.S. residents now consists of 
        approximately $10 trillion in long-lived infrastructure, of which over $6 T 
        is exclusive to fossil fuels. This system was built up over the past hundred 
        years and many components are very old. The mean age of U.S. pipelines, for example, 
        is over 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>The project is an effort of the University of Chicago’s Center for Robust Decision-making on 
        Climate and Energy Policy (RDCEP). Its research is documented in Chen et al 2020, 
        <a href="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~moyer/Inventory/Chen_etal_Energy_Inventory_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          “A Physical Inventory of the U.S. Energy System”</a>, 
        which includes documentation on data sources, validation, 
        and comparison to estimates of depreciated value (~50% of replacement value). This paper is 
        currently in preparation for peer review and is available here as a preprint. See also 
        <a href="https://www.rdcep.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.rdcep.org</a>  
        for further information. All data are available on request. Note that we show 2012 infrastructure, 
        and values are 2012 replacement costs at 2012 dollars and prices.

        <i>Features</i>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click items in menu to show a category of energy infrastructure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Total replacement cost of all displayed items is shown in header bar. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Costs for some items not displayed (e.g. foreign oil wells, or 
            electricity distribution) are shown in menu bar for reference.
          </li>
          <li>
            Symbol sizes for power plants, refineries, and coal mines are 
            scaled by their capacities.
          </li>
          <li>
            “Layers” category in menu allows displaying state boundaries or 
            mean wind speeds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zoom in or out with the mouse or the +/- buttons on the menu; 
            pan with the mouse. Menu and legend can be minimized or moved.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <i>Insights </i>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click on oil and gas wells, pipelines, and refineries to see the 
            U.S. network for liquid and gaseous fuels. High refinery capacity 
            on the Gulf coast serves both domestic offshore oil and crude oil 
            imports.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on coal mines, coal power plants, and railroads to see the U.S. coal 
            network. Note that many power plants are located near coal mines. Add in 
            high-voltage power lines to see how much of our high-voltage system is 
            designed to serve specific plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on wind farms, wind speeds, and high-voltage power lines to understand 
            the siting of wind turbines. U.S. wind turbines are not located in the center 
            of the mid-continent  “wind belt”  but cluster on its eastern side where they 
            can tap into the existing transmission network.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on solar facilities to understand the factors controlling their siting. 
            Solar facilities cluster in the high-sunshine Southwest but also in locations with 
            high state incentives, including North Carolina, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
          </li>
