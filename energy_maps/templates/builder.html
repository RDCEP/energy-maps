      <h4>About.</h4>

      <p>At a time when many people propose transforming the U.S.
        energy system, it is useful to understand its scale.  The U.S.
        Energy Infrastructure Visualization project documents all
        long-lived infrastructure (> 20 years service life) associated
        with extracting, processing, transporting, and using energy
        in the U.S.</p>
      <p>The energy system that delivers power to U.S. residents now
        consists of nearly $10 trillion in long-lived infrastructure,
        of which over $6 T is exclusive to fossil fuels. (Values are
        replacement costs as 2012 dollars and prices). This system was
        built up over the past hundred years and many components are
        very old: the mean age of U.S. pipelines, for example, is
        over 30 years.</p>
      <p>See link in header for a detailed description of the complete
        inventory, including documentation on data sources,
        validation, and comparison to estimates of depreciated
        value (~50% of replacement value).</p>
      <p>The project is conducted by members of the University of
        Chicago’s Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and
        Energy Policy (RDCEP), under the direction of Assoc. Professor
        Liz Moyer, Dept. of the Geophysical Sciences. The research
        lead on the project is Hsin-Yi Chen, U. Hawaii Dept. of
        Electrical Engineering. Graphics were built by Nathan Matteson
        and Benjamin Kleeman, DePaul University College of Computing
        and Digital Media. This application is in beta (please be
        patient). A paper describing the inventory is in preparation
        for submission to Proceedings of the National Academy of
        Sciences; the current release can be cited as Chen, Weisbach,
        Matteson, Brizius, and Moyer (2020), “A Physical Inventory
        of the U.S. Energy System.”</p>

      <h4>Contact.</h4>

      <p>We welcome comments and suggestions. Please send send feedback
        on the website to Nathan Matteson (nmatteso@depaul.edu) and on
        the inventory itself to Liz Moyer ( moyer@uchicago.edu). We
        would especially welcome input from energy experts on individual
        sections of the documentation.</p>
